# MagiCan

MagiCan is an iOS App that solves **poor financial management by providing simple financing for micro and small FnB enterprises by helping them record their income and expenses while summarizing the data.** This is a solution to the challenge because they tend to document their income and expenses with notebooks which limits their financial management combined with poor financial knowledge.

## Built with Love, and also:
- UIKit as UI Framework, but Programatically
- MVVM Architecture with Combine Framework
- External Web Services Integration (RESTful APIs)
